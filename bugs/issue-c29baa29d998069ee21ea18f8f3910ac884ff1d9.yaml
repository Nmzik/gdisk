title: Need more mbr tools.
desc: |-
  Right now MBR support is very limited.
  The original idea was that you'd use fdisk for mbr and gdisk for gpt.
  But you need to keep things in sync and it sucks to pop back and forth.

        [gdisk.c] Add "init-mbr-partition-from-gpt" command which is like init-mbr-from-gpt but merges in a single synced partition. (Re: #c29baa29d)
